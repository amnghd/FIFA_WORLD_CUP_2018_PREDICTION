# Predicting FIFA World Cup 2018


This repository is dedicated to the development of a model for predicting the FIFA wolrd cup 2018 to be held in June-July 2018.

The main data set for this project is provided through a Kaggle Data set named [International football results from 1872 to 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017/data).

There are five members in the group, namely (in the alphabetical order):

1- [Abhinav]()
2- [Amin Ghaderi](https://github.com/amnghd)
3- [Diehumblex]()
4- [Eleje Onyedika]()
5- [Marlysson](https://github.com/Marlysson)

# Project Outlines:

Here is where we brain storm on the project, its requirements, and its goals.

The followings can be the possible goals of working on this model:

1- (optional) predicting the champaion

2- (optional) predicting the qualifying games winner (or tie)

3- (optional) predicting the qualifying games results

4- (optional) If we have a model built up, we can update it with the results of the qualifying games for predicting play offs.


# Project Schedule

There is about 9 weeks untill the kick off.
The following could be our schedule:

``week1`` : formulating the challenge into a machine learning problem (group work)

``week2,3`` : data acquisition (independantly, with talk over the available data)

``week4,5`` : modelling (this will be done independantly, to assure to have all the unique ideas)

``week6,7``: ensembling (group work, to stack the models and get the final result)

``week8,9``: (optional) writing a notebook and presenting the results
