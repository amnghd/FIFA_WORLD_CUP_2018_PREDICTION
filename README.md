# Predicting FIFA World Cup 2018

This repository is dedicated to the development of a model for predicting the FIFA World Cup 2018 to be held in June-July 2018.

## Datasets

- [International football results from 1872 to 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017/data) ( **Main dataset** )
    > All matches from international football results from 1872 to 2018 with nearly 40,000 international football results
-  [European Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer)
    > 25k+ matches, players & teams attributes for European Professional Football
- [World Soccer](https://www.kaggle.com/sashchernuh/european-football/data)
    > World Soccer - archive of soccer results and odds. 20+ countries, 16 seasons, 30+ leagues, 130k+ matches with bookies odds
- [All world cup results](https://www.kaggle.com/abecklas/fifa-world-cup/data)
    > Results of all World Cup since 1930

- [Fifa game players attributes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/fifa-18-demo-player-dataset/data)
    > Dataset of all players's FIFA SOCCER 18 game

# Project Outlines:

Here is where we brain storm on the project, its requirements, and its goals.

The followings can be the possible goals of working on this model:

1- (optional) predicting the champaion

2- (optional) predicting the qualifying games winner (or tie)

3- (optional) predicting the qualifying games results

4- (optional) If we have a model built up, we can update it with the results of the qualifying games for predicting play offs.


# Project Schedule

There is about 9 weeks untill the kick off.
The following could be our schedule:

``Week 1`` : formulating the challenge into a machine learning problem (group work)

``Week 2-3`` : data acquisition (independantly, with talk over the available data)

``Week 4-5`` : modelling (this will be done independantly, to assure to have all the unique ideas)

``Week 6-7``: ensembling (group work, to stack the models and get the final result)

``Week 8-9``: (optional) writing a notebook and presenting the results


# Project Progress

- Data bases are saved and imported to the notebook as dataframes, Saturday 4/14/2018 ( **Amin Ghaderi** )
- Starting analysis related to win/loses/ties to know if a team is offensive or defensive, Sunday ( **Marlysson Silva** )
- Added win/lose ratio column and normalized the columns. Also added a column for continents. However, continent columns requires ome manual correction, Monday 4/16/2018, (**Amin Ghaderi**)
- Performed EDA on the FIFA 18 Complete Player Dataset. Engineered 8 features using the player age, value, and overal strength (**Amin Ghaderi**)
